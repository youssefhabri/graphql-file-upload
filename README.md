# FileUpload

## Installation

### Requirements

#### Postgres

This project requires [postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) to persist file upload information, if you wish to use a docker container for this, then I suggest you use the instructions for the [official image](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres).

Once you have completed the setup and configuration, you need to edit the [config file](./config/dev.exs) under the **Configure your database** section with the correct credentials for a database which can be used by the application.

### Native Method

- Install Elixir (following the [official installation guide](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html))
- Install Hex and Phoenix CLI:

```sh
$ mix local.hex
$ mix archive.install hex phx_new
```

*If you plan to edit the code and use the Eixir Language Server ([ElixirLS](https://github.com/elixir-lsp/elixir-ls)), make sure you have `esl-erlang` installed (or the appropriate package for your system), as ElixirLS might have issue if the Erlang platform is not fully installed.*


### Docker Method

Simply run the following commnad, and docker will build the image and start the application server at port `4000`

```sh
docker-compose up
```


## Setup and Usage

To start the `file-upload` server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Edit the `config/dev.ex` file with the appropriate information
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
